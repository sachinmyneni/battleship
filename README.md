# Battleship
Battleship game in BBC micro:bit v2

# Rules
Players take turns to pick a target and fire. Even when they hit an enemy target the opponents gets the next chance.

# Why
I was curious about the Microbit so got my hands on one and then I decided to see what I can do with it.. especially for my little ones to play with.<br>
The rules will change, mature and converge onto official rules over time.<br>
Right now my 8 yr old and 3.5 yr old will need to learn to take turns. <br>
The next step where the player with a succesfull hit continues will be a bit hard on my little one.. so we will build up to that :) 

I get to work on this some nights.. when I have the time. <br>
So my coding will be all over the place as I forget and recall the plans I had from the previous session..
